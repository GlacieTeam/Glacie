## What is Glacie?
Glacie is a server-side mod built on the LeviLamina mod loader that allows players to seamlessly connect to servers running a different version from their client—eliminating issues where version mismatches would normally prevent joining.

In essence, Glacie acts as a translator by converting differences in data packets between various versions, enabling players on different versions to connect to the server.
